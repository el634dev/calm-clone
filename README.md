## Setup
- The requirements for this project are simple and do not require much setup. You will need a code editor of your choice. I used VSCode because I could see the project in the browser using Live Server. 
- There are no dependencies for this project, only additional plugins if you would like to set them up in VSCode. 
- If you are unsure, then I would say Live Server if you would like to see your project and the changes you make to your project.
  >
   a. You can get Live Server by heading over to VSCode then clicking the on blocks in the side menu and search for Live Server then install
- You can download VSCode for free and this is developed by Microsoft.
  >
    b. Start by searching for VSCode in your browser and then download using the appropriate instllation link for your operating system.
